    <p>
      It's based on the fried rice my mom made for me growing up. Now it's my
      kids' favorite.
    </p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

      <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil, like sunflower or avocado</li>
      <li>6 ounces Spam, diced (Half a 12-ounce can)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, small diced</li>
      <li>1 medium carrot, small diced</li>

      <li>1 cup kimchi, drained and chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped curly kale, stems removed</li>
      <li>
        4 green onions, sliced into 1/4-inch slices, white and green parts
        separated
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup kimchi juice</li>
      <li>3 cups day-old, cold rice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>Toasted sesame seeds, to garnish</li>
      <li>4 fried eggs (1 per serving), optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Crisp the Spam:</h4>
        Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add
        the oil along with the Spam. Sauté until crispy around the edges, 3 to 4
        minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Cook the vegetables:</h4>
        <p>
          Add the onion and carrot to the skillet with the Spam drippings. Sauté
          on medium-high heat until the onions turn translucent and the carrots
          soften and take some color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
          Add the kimchi, kale, and white parts of the green onions and stir fry
          until the kimchi and kale start to caramelize and the onions are
          translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the kimchi juice and simmer until
          heated through.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Stir fry the rice:</h4>
        <p>
          Add the rice and toss until everything is combined evenly. Drizzle in
          the soy sauce and sesame oil as you continue mixing. Taste and adjust
          with more soy sauce, sesame oil, or kimchi juice if needed for flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn the heat down slightly and let the rice continue to cook,
          stirring occasionally, until some crispy bits can be seen on the
          bottom. Stir in the Spam and most of the green parts of the green
          onions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Serve the rice topped with the rest of the green onions and a
          sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds. Top each serving with a fried egg,
          if desired.
