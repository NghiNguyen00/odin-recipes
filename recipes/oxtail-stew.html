      <li>2 (475 ml) cups stock (chicken or beef)</li>
      <li>2 cups (475 ml) red wine</li>
      <li>
        2 carrots, cut into 1-inch segments, large pieces also cut lengthwise
      </li>
      <li>
        2 parsnips, cut into 1-inch segments, large pieces also cut lengthwise

      <li>2 turnips or rutabagas, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Brown the oxtails:</h4>
        <p>
          Pat the oxtails dry with paper towels. Sprinkle all over with salt and
          pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil on medium to medium-high heat
          in a 6-quart Dutch oven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in batches, and not crowding the pan, sear the oxtails in hot
          pan on all sides until golden brown. Use tongs to remove oxtails to a
          plate, setting aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Sauté the onions, carrots, and celery:</h4>
        Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery to the pan. Cook for a few
        minutes until the onions are translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>
          Add the oxtails, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, salt, stock, wine, then
          simmer:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Add the oxtails back to the pan. Add the whole garlic cloves, the
          stock, and wine. Add bay leaf, thyme, and half a teaspoon of salt.
          Bring to simmer. Reduce the heat to low.
        </p>
        <p>Cover and cook for 3 hours, until meat is fork tender.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</h4>
        About 1 hour before the meat is done, preheat the oven to roast the root
        vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Roast the root vegetables:</h4>
        <p>
          Toss carrots, parsnips, and turnips in olive oil in a roasting pan.
          Sprinkle well with salt and pepper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roast the vegetables for 1 hour, or until lightly browned and cooked
          through.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Skim the fat:</h4>
        <p>
          When the meat is tender, remove oxtails from the cooking liquid.
          Either skim the fat off the top with a spoon, use a fat separator to
          remove the fat, or chill the cooking liquid for several hours so that
          the fat solidifies, making it easier to remove.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are making ahead, at this point you can just put the stew in
          the refrigerator (let come to room temp first), with the oxtails still
          in it, and let it chill overnight. The next day, scrape off the fat,
          reheat, and then remove the meat from the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Strain the solids from the cooking liquid and reduce:</h4>
        <p>
          Pour the cooking liquid through a mesh strainer into a bowl, using a
          rubber spatula to press against the vegetable solids caught in the
          strainer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discard the solids. Return the liquid to the pan and simmer until
          reduced by half.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add back the oxtails and roasted vegetables:</h4>
        <p>
          Then add back in the oxtails, and add the roasted vegetables to the
          pan. Heat on low heat for half an hour for the flavors to meld.
        </p>
        <p>Add some chopped parsley before serving.</p>
